# DFS

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Key Points

- **Recursive or Iterative:** DFS can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack.
- **Applications:** Used in pathfinding, cycle detection, topological sorting, and solving puzzles.
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
