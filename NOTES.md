# Notes

## 1. Data Structures & Algorithms

- **Core Topics:** Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary, BST, heap, trie), graphs, hash tables.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting (quick, merge, bubble), searching (binary, linear), recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking.
- **Practice:** Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal to solve problems. Focus on time and space complexity analysis (Big O notation).

## 2. System Design

- **Key Concepts:** Scalability, reliability, availability, consistency, partition tolerance.
- **Components:** Load balancers, caching strategies (Redis, Memcached), databases (SQL, NoSQL), message queues, microservices, API design, CDN.
- **Preparation:** Study real-world architectures (e.g., designing Twitter, URL shorteners). Practice explaining trade-offs and drawing diagrams.

## 3. Computer Science Fundamentals

- **Operating Systems:** Processes vs threads, memory management, scheduling, deadlocks, file systems.
- **Networking:** OSI model, TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, firewalls, sockets, REST APIs.
- **Databases:** SQL vs NoSQL, normalization, indexing, transactions (ACID), CAP theorem, replication, sharding.

## 4. Behavioral Interviews

- **STAR Method:** Structure answers using Situation, Task, Action, Result.
- **Topics:** Teamwork, leadership, conflict resolution, overcoming challenges, learning from failure, project impact.
- **Preparation:** Reflect on past experiences and prepare concise stories that highlight your skills and growth.

## 5. Company Research

- **Products & Services:** Understand what the company builds and its target audience.
- **Mission & Values:** Align your answers to the companyâ€™s culture and goals.
- **Recent News:** Be aware of recent achievements, acquisitions, or changes.
- **Interview Process:** Research typical interview formats and questions for the company.

## 6. Mock Interviews

- **Practice:** Simulate interviews with friends, mentors, or online platforms (Pramp, Interviewing.io).
- **Feedback:** Seek constructive criticism to identify weaknesses.
- **Improvement:** Focus on communication, problem-solving approach, and time management.

## Additional Resources

- **Books:** "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, "System Design Interview" by Alex Xu, "Elements of Programming Interviews".
- **Online Courses:** Coursera, Udemy, Educative.io for DS&A and system design.
- **Communities:** Join forums like Blind, LeetCode Discuss, or Reddit for tips and experiences.
