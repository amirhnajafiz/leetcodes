# BFS

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## Time and Space Complexity (O Notation)

- **Time Complexity:** $O(V + E)$, where $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(V)$, due to storage of visited nodes and the queue.
- Efficient for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
- Performs well on both sparse and dense graphs.

## Features

- Explores nodes layer by layer
- Finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Uses a queue data structure

## Applications

- Shortest path finding
- Web crawlers
- Social networking sites
- Peer-to-peer networks
- GPS navigation
